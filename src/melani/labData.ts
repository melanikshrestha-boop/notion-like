 "oneLiner": "Yellow pigment made when hemoglobin from old red blood cells is broken down.",
 "simple": "Bilirubin is a yellow chemical pigment. When red blood cells finish their ~120-day life, hemoglobin is split: iron is recycled, and the heme ring is converted into unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. That form is not water-soluble, so it rides on albumin in the blood to the liver. Liver cells then conjugate it (attach glucuronic acid), making conjugated (direct) bilirubin water-soluble so it can enter bile, leave through the intestines, and leave the body in stool (that brown color is partly from bilirubin breakdown products). A little is also cleared by the kidneys in urine. “Total bilirubin” on a standard lab is the sum of unconjugated + conjugated. It is not a toxin score by itself; it is a checkpoint on the pipeline: red-cell turnover → blood transport → liver processing → bile exit. If any step speeds up (more cells dying) or bottlenecks (liver injury, bile duct blockage, enzyme quirks like Gilbert’s), total bilirubin can rise and, if high enough, skin or eyes can look yellow (jaundice).",

 "highMeans": "Too much production (hemolysis / more red-cell breakdown), slower liver conjugation, blocked bile flow, or a mix. Mild isolated bumps can be benign (e.g. Gilbert’s, fasting, hard training sometimes). Rising bilirubin with high ALT/AST or ALP, dark urine, pale stools, itching, or true jaundice needs a clinician, not guesswork.",
